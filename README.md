# Introduction
Mobile money applications, also known as branchless banking, have revolutionized financial
services in developing countries but often suffer from serious security vulnerabilities, as
highlighted in the paper “Mo(bile) Money, Mo(bile) Problems: Analysis of Branchless Banking
Applications in the Developing World.” Many apps lack proper SSL/TLS encryption, exposing
users to threats like MITM attacks, data leaks, and insecure cryptography. This project aims to
create a tool that combines static and manual analysis to detect these vulnerabilities. The tool
will analyze APK files, automate the methodology from the paper, and present results via a web
dashboard with report generation features.
